# Event Ticketing System

## Project Description

The Event Ticketing System is a decentralized smart contract solution built on Ethereum that revolutionizes how event tickets are created, sold, and managed. This blockchain-based system eliminates intermediaries, reduces fraud, and provides transparent ticket management for both event organizers and attendees.

The system allows event organizers to create events with specific parameters such as venue, date, ticket price, and capacity. Users can purchase tickets directly through the smart contract using Ether, with automatic payment distribution to organizers. Each ticket is uniquely identified and tracked on the blockchain, preventing counterfeiting and unauthorized duplication.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a trustless, transparent, and efficient ticketing ecosystem that:

- **Eliminates Fraud**: Blockchain immutability ensures authentic tickets that cannot be counterfeited
- **Reduces Costs**: Direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediary fees
- **Increases Transparency**: All transactions and ticket ownership are publicly verifiable
- **Empowers Users**: Gives control back to event organizers and attendees
- **Promotes Accessibility**: Creates a global platform accessible to anyone with an Ethereum wallet

We envision a future where event ticketing is completely decentralized, fraud-free, and accessible to everyone, regardless of geographical location or traditional banking access.
